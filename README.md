# java8-cipher
Tutorial project for encryption and signing data/messages easily with symmetric and asymmetric keys using Java.

You free to easy the classes directly from Maven Repository as helper classes, or dig through the code and implement your own code on your project.

## Installation
Checkout the project and import as a Maven project

## Usage
Obtain the last version from Maven Repository:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>br.com.joaovarandas</groupId>
    <artifactId>jcipher</artifactId>
    <version>0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

There are basically 3 helper classes available:
* AES - For symmetric encryption
* RSA - For signing and asymmetric encryption
* Hybrid - For hybrid encryption with asymmetric keys
